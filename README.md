# PyTarotDesktop

A Python desktop application for making and saving Tarot readings, inspired by the OBOD (druidry.org)[https://druidry.org/)] community.

This initial readme is based on (GitHub guidelines)[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes].

# What it does

The PyTarotDesktop includes the Python source code and configuration files for a desktop application for Tarot readings. The user can select a spread, enter their query, spread the cards, make their own notes on the spread, then save the reading to file.     

# Why it is useful

The Tarot is a divination approach with rich history and many resource in diverse decks and books. It fits well with modern Pagan practices, including those of the Order of Bards Ovates and Druids and (their courses)[https://druidry.org/our-courses].

The PyTarot dekstop application is useful for anyone that wishes to practice Tarot readings on their computer. As it is written in Python, it should be compatible with diverse platforms including Windows and macOS. Because it is configured from an import file in a standard format (currently (CSV)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values]), the user can write their own custom card keywords. Also, because each reading can be saved with reading notes that the user has added, it can support an ongoing Tarot journal practice. 

# How to get started

Users of the application need to download and install (Python)[https://www.python.org/] initially, then download and run the PyTarot source code. This is can be as simple as running `python3 pytarot.py` from the command line prompt. More details on running Python can be found at (realpython.com)[https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/#using-the-python-command].

# Where to get help

The PyTarotDesktop project is in a very early state, representing an alpha release. Currently there is only this readme, the partly-functional Help command within the application, and the comments within the sourcecode itself. 

# Who maintains and contributes to the project

Currently PyTarotDesktop is the work of single hobbyist Python developer and OBOD member, Joe Lewis-Bowen.
